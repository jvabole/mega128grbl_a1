# mega128grbl_a1
GRBL-1.1h port to mega128 and atmel studio 7
*******
translated by google translator from Latvian
*******
due to the availability of atmega128a processors for me, i created a GRBL port on atmega128a with the transition from arduino to atmel studio
*******
this is an alpha version, not fully programmed for "limit" and "control" tracking and interrupts
